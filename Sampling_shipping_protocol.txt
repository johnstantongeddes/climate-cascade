Sampling and shipping protocol
Sample size goal: 10-12 colonies per site, “species” determined by eye to the extent possible
1.  For each colony, record GPS coordinates & elevation & tentative ID
2. Collection protocol:
a. Collecting supplies: 1 large fluon-lined sweater-box, trowel, aspirator, shipping small Tupperware boxes and 50ml falcon tubes
b. When colony found in soil or log, make a concerted effort to locate and separate queen first
c. After queen found (or if not found), place log in sweaterbox and release nest contents into box.  If queen not yet located, search again after emptying out colony
d. Dump substrate into shipping Tupperware (up to 75% of box can be filled with substrate).  If substrate is dry, moisten with some water.  Add sufficient crumpled paper towel to fill airspace.
3. Shipping protocol:
a. Seal box edge with tape (painter’s tape to avoid gumminess?)
b. Queen tube – place in 50ml falcon tube with 5-10 workers, airhole in lid (one stab with a pocketknife works), add a cotton ball that is wet and then squeezed out, with one end threaded into the lid. 
c. Label both with site, colony # and date, tape together for shipping.
d. Send colonies as frequently as possible Fed Ex priority overnight, in cardboard box insulated with newspaper.  If expected temp high (>75-80 F), include coldpack wrapped in a towel into box.
