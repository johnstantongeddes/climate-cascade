This repository is *no longer active* and is kept for historical reasons only. 

At one point, I had a vision of all analyses for a grant ('climate-cascade') being within a single repository. This was both overly optimistic and not ideal. A better strategy is to have an Organization (e.g. GotelliLab) that will fork individual user's projects within the overall grant. 

In this vein, I've migrated the only project active within this repository 'ApTranscriptome' to it's own repository [ApTranscriptome](https://github.com/johnstantongeddes/ApTranscriptome) where all further development is being done.
