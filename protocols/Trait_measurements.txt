Trait measurements protocol

Receiving
Transfer colonies to new nest boxes (~100 workers in each nest)
Remove all brood, and then add 5 large larvae (to help break down protein)
Place in Phytotron (5 colonies per temperature treatment for each sampling region)

Samples to collect before
Live pupae [Aaron]
5 workers (CHC's) [Brian]
Stable isotope (before samples) [Katie]
Gut samples

Development Traits
Check for first appearance of eggs, larvae, pupae, and callow adults 
Collect dead workers weekly and freeze (for mortality rate)
After 80 days - weigh total workers and total brood
Remove 5 pupae per colony for dry-weight and head width (save dry pupae for stable isotope).
Get CTmax and CTmin at end of experiment [Katie]

Transcriptome samples
Select near-dark workers (10) for transcriptome at 1pm 
Static heat shock 37¼, 1hr, collect in LN2 (5 workers, and 5 control)
Store in -80 or LN2
Ship to UVM on dry ice


Temperatures (±3¼)
20, 23, 26, 31
