Food (ad lib feeding schedule) – modified Bhatkar from Dussutour & Simpson 2008 
Diet recipe
Agar	10g
dH20	500mL
(boil first, then mix with the following mixture)
Whole egg powder	35g
Whey protein	35g
Calcium caseinate	35g
Vanderzant vitamin	2g
Sucrose		165g
dH2O	250mL
(mix together, then combine with first mix; wait until agar mix is below 40C to preserve the vitamins)

Maintenance Schedule
Daily
For plaster nests, rewet plaster (DI water), change food (Bhatkar and dead insects), check that the lid is secure
For the smaller sandwich box nests, the fluon is no longer completely intact, so ants can get onto the undersides of the lids of the nest boxes – check for shadows of ants through the nest box lid before opening, and then carefully open lid to prevent ants escaping when feeding and watering
2 Days
Replace Bhatkar diet, mealworms and crickets approx. every 2 days 
Weekly
1x weekly, remove and freeze dead workers
